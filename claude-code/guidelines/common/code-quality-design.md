# Code Quality and Design Philosophy

> **Purpose**: Quality criteria and review perspectives for consistency, readability, and testability. Reference during code reviews and design decisions.

## Quick Reference

### Quality Standards

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| Consistency | Follow existing code style and design patterns |
| Readability | No self-indulgent coding |
| Magic numbers | Always extract as named constants |
| Naming | Care about function and variable names |

### Comment Principles

Code comment canonical: `guidelines/writing/code-comment.md` 参照 (default 書かない / 行数上限なし / Why not 中心)。

### Design Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Layered architecture | Flexible design prioritizing ease of change |
| Readable code | Split hard-to-read code; avoid long functions |
| Dependencies | Keep loosely coupled; do not use components from other pages |
| API responses are raw data | Return raw data without UI-specific aggregations; enables reuse across multiple UIs and reduces server-side spec changes |
| Single point of change | Design so spec changes require changes in only one place; extract and consolidate any duplication |

## Common Mistakes

| Avoid | Use | Reason |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `const name = "太郎"; // 名前を設定` | `const name = "太郎";` | Obvious comment unnecessary |
| `const MAX = 100;` | `const MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 100;` | Name expresses intent |
| 200-line function | Split into 10-50-line functions | Improves readability and testability |
| Importing components from other pages | Commonalize or copy | Maintains loose coupling |
